# Thermodynamic_Adsorption_Cycle
This is a model based on https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-4311(98)00013-1 that takes in sorption isotherms and calculates the COP of different staged regenerators with different pressure ratios. The code needs sorption isotherms at 2 different temperatuers, and then can fit whatever model you deem appropriate for the material. The Silicate-1 and MIL_Cr_53 notebooks were co-written with Pete Kim-Santos.
